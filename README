For our search approach we decided upon a basic A* algorithm. Through our use of a priority queue we decided which states we should check and which ones aren't worth searching. We considered each new state and if we recieved a duplicate state we would choose the one with the lower cost.

For our heuristic we started by breaking down the problem into more digestible terms. We found that by limiting the amount of wood, ore, and coal to just 1 our algorithm would be forced to smelt or make planks. This eliminated a lot of cases where the algorithm would search many cases that eventually led to the same result. We also limited the amount of each tool to just 1 because making anymore would be inefficient.

I hope you have a nice day! :)
